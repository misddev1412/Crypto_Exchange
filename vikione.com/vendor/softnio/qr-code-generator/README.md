# QR Code Generator for PHP

 Based on the popular library [PHP QR Code](http://phpqrcode.sourceforge.net), this package lets you create several different QR Codes.

 **Note**  
 Due to the number of permutations this library does, it is normal to have more than one QR Code for the same information.
   
 To demonstrate this behavior, start a server at the **public** folder, enter some data and hit the **Generate QR Code** button a few times.
  
 Each time you hit the button there is a chance a different QR Code with the same encoded information will be generated. 
 Independently of the number of permutations, this package will generate one and only one PNG or SVG file for each content, overwriting the latest one every time.

 ## Installation

 ```bash
 $ composer require softnio/qr-code-generator
